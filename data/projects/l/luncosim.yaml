description:
  LunCo is a decentralized, open‑source initiative aiming to collaboratively design and simulate lunar settlement infrastructure via a web3‑enabled “Lunar Colony Simulator.”
  Its platform integrates 3D simulation, mission modeling, and web3 mechanisms (e.g. NFT design assets, collaborative modules) to enable community participation in lunar engineering.
  The project is currently in a “PreDAO” phase and invites contributions across software, design, engineering, and community development.
