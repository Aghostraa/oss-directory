description: Etherex is a MetaDEX on Linea, unlike other DEXs, Etherex sends 100% of trading fees to stakers and 100% of liquidity rewards to LPsâ€”no cuts to insiders or teams. Its native token, REX, powers a flywheel of rewards, LPs earn REX, and staking REX into xREX gives you governance rights and a share of all trading fees. Designed on the Ramses v3 engine, Etherex supports concentrated liquidity, efficient swaps, and full governance control
