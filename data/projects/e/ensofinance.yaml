description:
  Enso is a shared on‑chain execution network and intent‑based infrastructure that lets developers and users compose, bundle, and automate DeFi interactions across multiple chains via “Actions” and “Shortcuts.”
  It abstracts away low‑level integration by exposing a unified engine that can generate executable bytecode for smart contract operations.
