description:
  Squid Router is a cross‑chain liquidity router that enables users to swap tokens and bridge assets across 100+ blockchains via optimized routes.
  It uses multi‑protocol “hopping” combining bridges (e.g. Axelar, CCTP, IBC, Chainflip) and intent‑based routing (CORAL) to interoperate across ecosystems.
