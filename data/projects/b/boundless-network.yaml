description: Boundless is a decentralized protocol offering verifiable compute services across blockchains by enabling off‑chain computation with zero‑knowledge proofs. Prover nodes perform useful work, stake collateral, and are rewarded via the network’s native token (ZKC). The system supports rollups, apps, oracles, and aims to decouple execution from consensus for better scalability.
