description:
  Boundless is a universal ZK (zero-knowledge) compute protocol that enables
  verifiable compute across any blockchain without requiring global re-execution.
  It rewards independent node operators (“provers”) for generating proofs and allows
  developers to build expressive, scalable applications that inherit native chain
  security with dramatically reduced on-chain compute costs.
