description:
  ornado Cash is a non‑custodial privacy protocol on EVM chains that uses zero‑knowledge proofs to break the on‑chain link between deposits and withdrawals.
  It lets users deposit ETH or ERC‑20 tokens into “anonymity pools” and later withdraw them to different addresses without revealing transactional linkage.
