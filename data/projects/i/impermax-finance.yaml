description:
  Impermax is a crossâ€‘chain, permissionless decentralized lending protocol that lets users act as lenders or borrowers via isolated lending pools.
  Lenders supply tokens to earn yield without impermanent loss, while borrowers can deposit LP tokens as collateral to leverage yield farming.
  The platform also issues an IBEX governance token tied to protocol revenue.
